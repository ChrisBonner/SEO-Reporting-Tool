# SEO-Reporting-Tool

After a short analysis and discovery period with the SEO team. I was able to identify struggles with efficiency due to the lack of software.

Taking the initiative with my free time, I developed a javascript program, which resulted in a 60% decrease in time SEO Managers spent creating and processing monthly reports.

The tool lets SEO managers copy and paste data from the companies proprietary system, such as Google Analytics, Google AdWords and Blogging data for assigned clients. Because the companies reporting system sends out the reports via email, I had to be very specific and careful with wrapping all calculations in HTML.

The system is broken into 4 sections. Work performed, Performance Notes, PPC Notes, and Services & other notes.

The SEO Manager can enter in what work was performed, easily edit/add educational snippets of information in the Work Performed section. In both the performance notes and PPC notes the SEO manager can update/add notes regarding the website/PPC performance. Finally, in the Service & Other notes section, the SEO manager can select/update or add additional notes regarding services offered or additional comments.

Once all the data is set, the SEO Manager can process the input and the system will do some calculations and return both a preview and an HTML block of what the report looks like.
